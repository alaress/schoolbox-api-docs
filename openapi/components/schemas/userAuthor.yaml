      The user's first name.

      Schoolbox doesn't distinguish between a person's actual first name
      and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
      naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the
      user's given name.
    example: Rebecca

  preferredName:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The user's preferred name.
  
  lastName:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The user's surname.
    example: White

  fullName:
    type: string
    nullable: false
    description: The user's formatted full name.

  isDeleted:
    type: boolean
    nullable: false
    description: Whether the user is deleted or not.
