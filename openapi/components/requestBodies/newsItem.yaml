            A single featured image to attach to this news item, supplied as a
            pointer to a file in Schoolbox. This parameter may be provided no
            more than once.

            The pointer will be in the format: `$locator:$location:$filename`;
            the variables within the pointer have this meaning:
            * `$locator` represents the strategy for finding the file:
              * `store` for files uploaded to Schoolbox's storage
              * `browse` finds files in Schoolbox's resource browser
              * `myfile` finds files in a Schoolbox user's My Files browser
              * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
            * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
              * for `store` this is a file's unique hash
              * for `browse` and `myfile` this is a file ID
              * for `office365` this is the file's unique node
            * `$filename` is the filename that the file will be given once it is
              uploaded to wherever it is being uploaded

            See the [Upload a file to Schoolbox](#operation/storageAsyncUpload)
            endpoint for details on how to upload a file, and receive a file
            pointer from that upload.

            Files to attach to this news item, supplied as pointers to a file in
            Schoolbox. This parameter may be provided multiple times to attach
            multiple files.

            Each pointer will be in the format: `$locator:$location:$filename`;
            the variables within the pointer have this meaning:
            * `$locator` represents the strategy for finding the file:
              * `store` for files uploaded to Schoolbox's storage
              * `browse` finds files in Schoolbox's resource browser
              * `myfile` finds files in a Schoolbox user's My Files browser
              * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
            * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
              * for `store` this is a file's unique hash
              * for `browse` and `myfile` this is a file ID
              * for `office365` this is the file's unique node
            * `$filename` is the filename that the file will be given once it is
              uploaded to wherever it is being uploaded

        audience:

          required: true
          description: |
            A comma-separated list of audiences for this news item.

            Each audience will be in one of two formats:
            * simple audiences: `$entityType:$entityValue:$relationship`
            * composite audiences: `composite;$relationship;`, then two simple
              audiences, delimited by a `.` character

            The variables within each audience string have this meaning:
            * `$entityType` is the type of audience: currently out of
              `campus`, `folder`, `role`, `school_house`, `year`
            * `$entityValue` is the identifier for the audience, JSON-encoded
              then base64-encoded
            * `$relationship` is the users who are actually in the identified
              audience:
              * `self` for the users associated directly with the audience
              * `teachers_of` for the teachers of users in the audience
              * `parents_of` for the parents of users in the audience

            Composite audiences will only contain users who are in both of the
            simple audiences.

            Examples:
            * `campus:IjEi:self` is a simple audience, targeting users in campus
              ID 1
            * `folder:IjU1Ig==:parents_of` is a simple audience, targeting
              parents of users in folder ID 55
            * `folder:IjU1Ig==:parents_of` is a simple audience, targeting
              parents of users in folder ID 55
            * `folder:Ijki==:teachers_of` is a simple audience, targeting
              teachers of users in year ID 9
            * `composite;self;campus:IjIi:self.year:IjQi:self` is a composite
              audience, targeting the intersection of:
              * users in campus ID 2
              * users in year ID 3
