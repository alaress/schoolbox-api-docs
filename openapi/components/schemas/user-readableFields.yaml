  guardians:
    description: |
      This user's guardians. (Only applicable if this user is of role
      type: student.)
      
      Guardians are not necessarily the same thing as parents: a guardian
      is not always the child's parent (e.g. they may be a foster parent
      or other relative), and a parent is not always the child's guardian
      (e.g. the family might have separated).

    example:
      - id: 25
        fullName: Janna Reed
        yearLevel: [ ]
        role:
          id: 3
          name: Parent
  
  students:
    description: |
      This user's students. (Only applicable if this user is of role type:
      parent.)
      
      Students are not necessarily the same thing as children, for the
      same reason that guardians are not the same thing as parents.
      
      Generally, the guardian => student relation is symmetrical to the
      student => guardian relation.

  impersonableUsers:
    description: |
      The users whom this user may impersonate within a Schoolbox session.
      
      This relation is asymmetric: A may impersonate B, but that does not
      imply that B may impersonate A.

        yearLevel:
          id: 3
          name: 3

      This may be derived from the user's username and the instance's
