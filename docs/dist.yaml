        This endpoint is intended so that in-browser API calls performed within
        a Schoolbox instance may be performed in a manner more in common with
        calls to a remote API.

        This endpoint only makes sense for users authenticated with the "session"
        security scheme, as it returns a token which is used by the "bearerAuth"
        scheme.

            Guardians are not necessarily the same thing as parents: a guardian
            is not always the child's parent (e.g. they may be a foster parent
            or other relative), and a parent is not always the child's guardian
            (e.g. the family might have separated).

            Students are not necessarily the same thing as children, for the
            same reason that guardians are not the same thing as parents.

            Generally, the guardian => student relation is symmetrical to the
            student => guardian relation.

        but the datetime input was developed before JSON was used for request bodies.

        The variables within the pointer have this meaning:
        * `$locator` represents the strategy for finding the file:
          * `store` for files uploaded to Schoolbox's storage
          * `browse` finds files in Schoolbox's resource browser
          * `myfile` finds files in a Schoolbox user's My Files browser
          * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
        * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
          * for `store` this is a file's unique hash
          * for `browse` and `myfile` this is a file ID
          * for `office365` this is the file's unique node
        * `$filename` is the filename that the file will be given once it is uploaded
          to wherever it is being uploaded

        See the [Upload a file](#post-/storage/asyncUpload.php)
        endpoint for details on how to upload a file, and receive a file
        pointer from that upload.
    audience:
      type: string
      description: |
        A description of a news audience, in one of two formats:

        * for composite audiences: `composite;$relationship;`, then two
          simple audiences, delimited by a `.` character

        The variables within the audience string have this meaning:
        * `$entityType` is the type of audience: currently out of
          `campus`, `folder`, `role`, `school_house`, `year`
        * `$entityValue` is the identifier for the audience, JSON-encoded
          then base64-encoded
        * `$relationship` is the users who are actually in the identified
          audience:
          * `self` for the users associated directly with the audience
          * `teachers_of` for the teachers of users in the audience
          * `parents_of` for the parents of users in the audience

        Composite audiences will only contain users who are in both of the
        simple audiences.
      examples:
        - summary: Simple audience (users in campus ID 1)
          value: campus:IjEi:self
        - summary: Simple audience (parents of users in folder ID 55)

                and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
                naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the

                Schoolbox doesn't distinguish between a person's actual first name
                and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
                naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the
                user's given name.

                  A single featured image to attach to this news item, supplied as a
                  pointer to a file in Schoolbox. This parameter may be provided no
                  more than once.

                  The pointer will be in the format: `$locator:$location:$filename`;
                  the variables within the pointer have this meaning:
                  * `$locator` represents the strategy for finding the file:
                    * `store` for files uploaded to Schoolbox's storage
                    * `browse` finds files in Schoolbox's resource browser
                    * `myfile` finds files in a Schoolbox user's My Files browser
                    * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
                  * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
                    * for `store` this is a file's unique hash
                    * for `browse` and `myfile` this is a file ID
                    * for `office365` this is the file's unique node
                  * `$filename` is the filename that the file will be given once it is
                    uploaded to wherever it is being uploaded

                  See the [Upload a file](#post-/storage/asyncUpload.php)
                  endpoint for details on how to upload a file, and receive a file
                  pointer from that upload.

                  multiple files.

                  Each pointer will be in the format: `$locator:$location:$filename`;
                  the variables within the pointer have this meaning:

                    * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
                  * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
                    * for `store` this is a file's unique hash

                  A comma-separated list of audiences for this news item.

                  Each audience will be in one of two formats:
                  * simple audiences: `$entityType:$entityValue:$relationship`
                  * composite audiences: `composite;$relationship;`, then two simple
                    audiences, delimited by a `.` character

                  The variables within each audience string have this meaning:
                  * `$entityType` is the type of audience: currently out of
                    `campus`, `folder`, `role`, `school_house`, `year`
                  * `$entityValue` is the identifier for the audience, JSON-encoded
                    then base64-encoded
                  * `$relationship` is the users who are actually in the identified
                    audience:
                    * `self` for the users associated directly with the audience
                    * `teachers_of` for the teachers of users in the audience
                    * `parents_of` for the parents of users in the audience

                  Composite audiences will only contain users who are in both of the
                  simple audiences.

                  Examples:
                  * `campus:IjEi:self` is a simple audience, targeting users in campus
                    ID 1
                  * `folder:IjU1Ig==:parents_of` is a simple audience, targeting
                    parents of users in folder ID 55
                  * `folder:IjU1Ig==:parents_of` is a simple audience, targeting
                    parents of users in folder ID 55
                  * `folder:Ijki==:teachers_of` is a simple audience, targeting
                    teachers of users in year ID 9
                  * `composite;self;campus:IjIi:self.year:IjQi:self` is a composite
                    audience, targeting the intersection of:
                    * users in campus ID 2
                    * users in year ID 3

                    * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
                  * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
                    * for `store` this is a file's unique hash

                  * `$filename` is the filename that the file will be given once it is uploaded to wherever it is being uploaded

                  See the [Upload a file](#post-/storage/asyncUpload.php) endpoint for details on how to upload a file, and receive a file pointer from that upload.
