  summary: Get a list of assessments
  description: |
    This endpoint will return assessments and their results that match the filter provided. 
    The number of assessments returned is 5 by default, if the limit query parameter is not provided.
    We strongly recommend the use of due date filters, to ensure you only get relevant assessments from the current period.
    For example a common request may be to get assessments of work type 'major' that are due in the current year. 
    
    The endpoint is only available to superusers.
