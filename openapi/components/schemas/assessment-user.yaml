title: User
type: object
properties:

  id:
    $ref: ./id.yaml

  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true

      The user's first name.

      Schoolbox doesn't distinguish between a person's actual first name
      and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
      naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the
      user's given name.
    example: Rebecca

  preferredName:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The user's preferred name.
  
  lastName:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The user's surname.
    example: White

  externalId:
    $ref: ./externalId.yaml
