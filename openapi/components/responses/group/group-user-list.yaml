                  Schoolbox doesn't distinguish between a person's actual first name
                  and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
                  naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the
                  user's given name.
                example: Rebecca

              preferredName:
                type: string
                nullable: true
                description: The user's preferred name.

              givenName:
                type: string
                nullable: false
                description: The user's preferred name, if set. If preferred name is not set, returns the user's first name.
                example: John

              lastName:
                type: string
                nullable: true
                description: The user's surname.

                description: |
                  The user's full name: usually, this is the title, first name and last
                  name joined together.
                example: Mr John Smith

              role:
