  A pointer to a file within Schoolbox, in the format:
  `$locator:$location:$filename`

  The variables within the pointer have this meaning:
  * `$locator` represents the strategy for finding the file:
    * `store` for files uploaded to Schoolbox's storage
    * `browse` finds files in Schoolbox's resource browser
    * `myfile` finds files in a Schoolbox user's My Files browser
    * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
  * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
    * for `store` this is a file's unique hash
    * for `browse` and `myfile` this is a file ID
    * for `office365` this is the file's unique node
  * `$filename` is the filename that the file will be given once it is uploaded
    to wherever it is being uploaded

  See the [Upload a file](#post-/storage/asyncUpload.php)
  endpoint for details on how to upload a file, and receive a file
  pointer from that upload.
