  summary: Get a list of assessments
  description: |
    This endpoint will return assessments and their results that match the filter provided. 
    The number of assessments returned is 5 by default, if the limit query parameter is not provided.
    There is a maximum limit of 500 assessments per request.
    We strongly recommend the use of due date filters, to ensure you only get relevant assessments from the current period.
    For example a common request may be to get assessments of work type 'major' that are due in the current year. 
    
    The endpoint is only available to superusers.

      Json encoded object of fields and values to filter assessments on. \
      For example, to get assessment with ID 676: \
      `filter=%7b%22assessmentId%22%3a676%7d`
