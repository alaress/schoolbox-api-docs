  The response that the API returns if it was unable or unwilling to fulfill a
  request.

  If the request's "Accept" header is "application/json", this will conform to
  the [RFC7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) Problem Details
  specification; otherwise, it may be a HTML document which contains a textual
  description of the error. For this reason, the "Accept" header should always
  be set to "application/json".
