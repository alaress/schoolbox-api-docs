# I suppose that a session cookie counts as a apiKey?
type: apiKey
in:   cookie
name: PHPSESSID
description: |
  A cookie which represents a session which has already been authenticated as a
  particular Schoolbox user.

  The authentication may have occurred via Schoolbox's login form, or via a
  third-party identity provider.

  Expect that this security scheme will be deprecated in the near future, when
  an API token based authentication scheme is implemented.
