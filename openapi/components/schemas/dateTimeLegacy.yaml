title: Datetime (Legacy)
description: |
  A JSON representation of a datetime.
  For compatibility with existing code, can be defined as either:
  * a RFC3339 string
  * an object, which contains a datetime in several formats

  Code using this representation should support both formats, with the knowledge
  that the object representation is deprecated and will be removed eventually.
