  summary: Get a list of assessments
  description: |
    This endpoint will return all assessments and their results that match the filter provided.  We strongly recommend the use of due date filters, to ensure you only get relevant assessments from the current period.  For example a common request may be to get assessments of work type 'major' that are due in the current year.
