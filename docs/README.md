# Published Documents

## template.html

The template ReDoc document which is served when running `npm run start`, and
used as the basis for the static document compiled by `npm run build-static`.

## index.html

The static document compiled by `npm run build-static`, and published to GitHub
Pages.

Do not edit this file manually: instead, run `npm run build-static` when the
API changes, and commit the changes to this file.

## logo.png

The logo for the API document, as specified in `openapi/openapi.yaml` key
`info.x-logo.url`.

## Other files

Any other files within this folder will be accessible by both the template, and
the static document once published.

For example, `favicon.ico` is the icon for both the template, and the published
document.
