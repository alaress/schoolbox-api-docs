  guardians:
    description: |
      This user's guardians. (Only applicable if this user is of role
      type: student.)
      
      Guardians are not necessarily the same thing as parents: a guardian
      is not always the child's parent (e.g. they may be a foster parent
      or other relative), and a parent is not always the child's guardian
      (e.g. the family might have separated).

      - id: 25
        externalId: "25001"

        preferredName: null
        givenName: Janna

  students:
    description: |
      This user's students. (Only applicable if this user is of role type:
      parent.)
      
      Students are not necessarily the same thing as children, for the
      same reason that guardians are not the same thing as parents.
      
      Generally, the guardian => student relation is symmetrical to the
      student => guardian relation.

      This relation is asymmetric: A may impersonate B, but that does not
      imply that B may impersonate A.
