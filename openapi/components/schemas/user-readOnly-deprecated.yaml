  The existing set of read-only user fields.

  (The code which outputs a user in this format was built before the user API
   was designed, and is expected to be replaced by the user API.)
type: object
properties:
  id:
    $ref: ./id.yaml

  externalId:
    $ref: ./externalId.yaml

  title:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The user's title (Mr., Ms., etc.).

  firstname:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: |
      The user's first name.

      Schoolbox doesn't distinguish between a person's actual first name
      and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
      naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the
      user's given name.

  lastname:
    type: string
    nullable: true
    description: The user's surname.

required:
  - id
readOnly: true
deprecated: true
