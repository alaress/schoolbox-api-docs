            Schoolbox doesn't distinguish between a person's actual first name
            and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
            naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the
            user's given name.
          example: Rebecca
        lastName:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          description: The user's surname.
          example: White
        preferredName:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          description: The user's preferred name.
