        This endpoint is intended so that in-browser API calls performed within
        a Schoolbox instance may be performed in a manner more in common with
        calls to a remote API.

        This endpoint only makes sense for users authenticated with the "session"
        security scheme, as it returns a token which is used by the "bearerAuth"
        scheme.

        This endpoint will return assessments and their results that match the filter provided. 
        The number of assessments returned is 5 by default, if the limit query parameter is not provided.
        We strongly recommend the use of due date filters, to ensure you only get relevant assessments from the current period.
        For example a common request may be to get assessments of work type 'major' that are due in the current year. 

        The endpoint is only available to superusers.

            Schoolbox doesn't distinguish between a person's actual first name
            and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
            naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the
            user's given name.

            Guardians are not necessarily the same thing as parents: a guardian
            is not always the child's parent (e.g. they may be a foster parent
            or other relative), and a parent is not always the child's guardian
            (e.g. the family might have separated).

            Students are not necessarily the same thing as children, for the
            same reason that guardians are not the same thing as parents.

            Generally, the guardian => student relation is symmetrical to the
            student => guardian relation.

          * `browse` finds files in Schoolbox's resource browser
          * `myfile` finds files in a Schoolbox user's My Files browser
          * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
        * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
          * for `store` this is a file's unique hash
          * for `browse` and `myfile` this is a file ID
          * for `office365` this is the file's unique node
        * `$filename` is the filename that the file will be given once it is uploaded
          to wherever it is being uploaded

                        The user's first name.

                        Schoolbox doesn't distinguish between a person's actual first name
                        and any other names, and in any case is not the definitive source of
                        naming information; therefore in practice this will usually be the
                        user's given name.
                      example: Rebecca
                    preferredName:
                      type: string
                      nullable: true
                      description: The user's preferred name.
                    givenName:
                      type: string
                      nullable: false
                      description: The user's preferred name, if set. If preferred name is not set, returns the user's first name.
                      example: John
                    lastName:
                      type: string
                      nullable: true
                      description: The user's surname.
                      example: White
                    fullName:
                      type: string
                      description: |
                        The user's full name: usually, this is the title, first name and last
                        name joined together.
                      example: Mr John Smith
                    role:
                      type: string
                      description: The name of the Role, may not be unique.
                      example: Staff
                    isStaff:
                      type: boolean
                      example: true
                    campus:

                      description: Comma-separated list of campuses to which the user belongs.
                      example: Senior, Junior

                      type: string
                      description: Name of the year level to which the user belongs, or blank if not applicable.
                      example: Year 9

                  A single featured image to attach to this news item, supplied as a
                  pointer to a file in Schoolbox. This parameter may be provided no
                  more than once.

                  The pointer will be in the format: `$locator:$location:$filename`;
                  the variables within the pointer have this meaning:
                  * `$locator` represents the strategy for finding the file:
                    * `store` for files uploaded to Schoolbox's storage
                    * `browse` finds files in Schoolbox's resource browser
                    * `myfile` finds files in a Schoolbox user's My Files browser
                    * `office365` finds files in an Office365 store
                  * `$location` is the location of the file within `$locator`:
                    * for `store` this is a file's unique hash
                    * for `browse` and `myfile` this is a file ID
                    * for `office365` this is the file's unique node
                  * `$filename` is the filename that the file will be given once it is
                    uploaded to wherever it is being uploaded

                  See the [Upload a file](#post-/storage/asyncUpload.php)
                  endpoint for details on how to upload a file, and receive a file

                  A comma-separated list of audiences for this news item.

                  Each audience will be in one of two formats:
                  * simple audiences: `$entityType:$entityValue:$relationship`
                  * composite audiences: `composite;$relationship;`, then two simple
                    audiences, delimited by a `.` character

                  The variables within each audience string have this meaning:
                  * `$entityType` is the type of audience: currently out of
                    `campus`, `folder`, `role`, `school_house`, `year`
                  * `$entityValue` is the identifier for the audience, JSON-encoded
                    then base64-encoded
                  * `$relationship` is the users who are actually in the identified
                    audience:
                    * `self` for the users associated directly with the audience
                    * `teachers_of` for the teachers of users in the audience
                    * `parents_of` for the parents of users in the audience

                  Composite audiences will only contain users who are in both of the
                  simple audiences.

                  Examples:
                  * `campus:IjEi:self` is a simple audience, targeting users in campus
                    ID 1
                  * `folder:IjU1Ig==:parents_of` is a simple audience, targeting
                    parents of users in folder ID 55
                  * `folder:IjU1Ig==:parents_of` is a simple audience, targeting
                    parents of users in folder ID 55
                  * `folder:Ijki==:teachers_of` is a simple audience, targeting
                    teachers of users in year ID 9
                  * `composite;self;campus:IjIi:self.year:IjQi:self` is a composite
                    audience, targeting the intersection of:
                    * users in campus ID 2
                    * users in year ID 3
